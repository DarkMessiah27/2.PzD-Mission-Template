If you want a framework for making ARMA missions and aren't a member of 2.PzD I strongly recommend the Olsen Framework.

[IFA3 Lite](https://forums.bistudio.com/forums/topic/190809-iron-front-in-arm3-lite-preview-versions/) and [FOW](https://forums.bistudio.com/forums/topic/198194-faces-of-war-ww2/) teams and [Lennard](https://forums.bistudio.com/forums/topic/200914-len-weapons-pack-for-ifa3-lite/) for their respective mods which provide essential assets for ARMA3 gameplay in a WWII setting.
